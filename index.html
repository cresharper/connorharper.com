		<!-- About Me -->
		<div class="site-section" id="about-me">
			<h2 class="sub-header">A Little Bit About Me</h2>
			<p class="paragraph">I am a Web Developer and Designer that has experience helping businesses and individuals acheive their goals related to digital presence. I've taken on projects ranging from making landing pages for local bands to developing the Front End for corporation websites with hundreds of thousands of visitors. There isn't an assingment that scares me, and whatever I don't know, I will learn and get the job done.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">I started my career in 2011 on the path to become a Graphic Designer. During this time I was slowly developing an interest in Web Development and Design. In the Summer of 2013, I picked up my first freelance client doing very basic web work on a Magento online store. The word got out that I was working freelance, and the rest is history!</p>
			<p class="paragraph">My technical knowledge includes but is not limited to HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and jQuery as well as the Adobe Creative suite. For a full rundown on my technical skills and work experience, <a href="http://connorharper.com/resume/Resume_Connor_Harper_9_7_16(1).pdf">please download my resume.</a></p>
